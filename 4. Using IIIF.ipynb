    "1. Ask the user for a word\n",
    "1. `For` each line of text `in` the TEI XML:\n",

    "    1. Calculate the coordinates for the corresponding line of text in the image\n",

    "We could do this dynamically using IIIF, but it will be slow (especially with everyone trying to do it all at once). For that reason, there is a copy of the image in your folder of course materials, called Montaignef22_25pct.jpg. This is simply the image scaled down to 25% that we have been working with so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention**: There is a catch here! We want to select the region of the image and also scale the original image to 25%. In IIIF, the standard says that _first_ you select the region, and _then_ you scale it. However, here, we have already _first_ downloaded the image at 25% and _then_ we want to select the region. This means that our coordinates are for the original image, but we need to apply these coordinates to the smaller image that is one quarter the size of the original. For this reason, we must also divide all our coordinates by four as well.\n",

This is likely to get you in trouble, as it could be interpreted as a common hacking activity (a ['denial of service'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) or DOS attack). This is likely to mean you will be blocked from the BnF website, and could theoretically even result in a crimina investigation! For this reason, we test our results first by printing out to the screen and making sure that our code is working. Only then do we really connect to the actual website."

To do this, we need to change the URLs of each address, specifically, the part that says `/full/full/0` we want to change to `/full/pct:25/0` (for '25 percent').

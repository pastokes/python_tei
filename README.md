# Python TEI
Introductory training materials for Python applied to XML TEI

These are brief notes and exercises on working with TEI XML files using Python. They are intended as teaching aids for the course on 'Image Processing with Python' which is part of the Atelier de formation annuel du Consortium Cahier on the topic of 'Exploiter les corpus d'auteurs' in Poitiers, 18–20 June 2019. For more details see https://cahier.hypotheses.org/4662

These notes assume a good knowledge of TEI XML but assume no experience or knowledge at all in programming. They also assume that Beautiful Soup 4 has already been installed in your Python system, and that some files have already been downloaded and saved in the same directory as the notebooks (see specific notebooks for details).

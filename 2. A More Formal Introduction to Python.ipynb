If you know an earlier version of Python such as Python 2.7, then you can also skip this section, but be aware that `print 'hello'` is no longer valid: in Python 3 you must always include the parentheses, so `print('hello')` instead."

    "To create a new variable for storing data in memory, simply provide a unique name for that variable and use `=` to assign the content. Note that you can re-assign different content to an existing variable, in which case the new content will simply replace the old (hence the name 'variable'). You can have as many different variables as you like, as long as your computer doesn't run out of RAM. This is unlikely with modern computers, but it is possible if you have very large images.\n",

    "Notice also the `#` symbol. This is to signal a 'comment': i.e. everything after `#` on that line is a comment for us humans to read and so will be ignored by Python. It is very good practice to add comments as a reminder to you and a message to others of what your code does. You will be grateful when you come back to your code in a year's time!"
